# Angular2 Boilerplate (TS, Sass, Pug)

Angular2 boilerplate written in **Typescript**, **Sass** and **Pug** (formerly Slim) compiled with **Gulp**.

`npm install && npm start`

# Disclaimer: This was an experiment

This is compiled with gulp and is very slow, it has no build output either. I have tried to convert this to be compiled exclusively via Webpack using Sass and component includes and it's just very complicated. I suggest you use [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
